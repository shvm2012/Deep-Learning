# Deep-Learning
Welcome to my Deep Learning repository. Here you can find beginner friendly Deep_learning code snippets with applied on academic focussed datasets.

I will mainly use two types of framework for my coding. One is high level API KERAS (which uses tensorflow backend) and PYTORCH which a low level API and very easy to adapt for people who loves numpy. 

:)
Happy Learning
